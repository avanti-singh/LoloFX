## Name: Avanti Singh
## Project Title: Lolo F(x)

### What have you done for your project so far?
I've made the Saturator and Filter modules and a really basic Plugin Processer / Editor setup. 

### What have you not done for your project yet?
I need to do the Sample playback module to play back and loop 5 types of sounds - rain, crackle, conversations, white noise, and glitchy vibes.

I also need to finalise the GUI, I've followed some tutorials, but I need to make it way better. 

I also want to make my filter code better - I'm not really sure if it's good. 

I need to test all of the modules and hear what they actually sound like.

### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Just lots of bugs here and there, particularly with defining and instantiating classes in different places and heirarchies.
